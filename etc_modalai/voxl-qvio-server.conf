/**
 * This file contains configuration that's specific to voxl-qvio-server.
 *
 * voxl-qvio-server also uses parameters from the following config files:
 * /etc/modalai/extrinsics.conf
 * /data/modalai/opencv_tracking_intrinsics.yml
 *
 * parameter descriptions:
 *
 * mask_file_path: A file path for qvio mask.
 * 1/4 resolution image (w.r.t. VGA), 160 x 120,
 * PGM format, the part of the camera view for which
 * pixels are set to 255 is blocked from feature
 * detection useful, e.g., to avoid detecting & tracking
 * points on landing gear reaching into camera view.
 *
 * imu_name: VOXL uses imu1 by defualt since it's the most reliable. On
 * VOXL-FLIGHT you can optionally try imu0 which is a newer icm42688
 * voxl-configure-mpa will decide which IMU to use for you.
 *
 * cam_name: camera to use, defaults to tracking0
 *
 * odr_hz: Output data date is independent from the camera frame rate so you can
 * choose the desired output data rate. Note that voxl-imu-server defaults to
 * 500hz imu sampling but new data is received by voxl-qvio-server at 100hz by
 * default so requesting qvio data faster requires updating voxl-imu-server.
 *
 * use_camera_height_bootstrap: When enabled, the feature estimator will assume
 * the system starts up with the camera pointed partially at the ground and use
 * this to make an intial guess of the feature's depth. This should be enabled
 * for drones that have known-height landing gear.
 *
 * camera_height_off_ground_m: camera distance above ground (meters) for the
 * above bootstrap feature.
 *
 * enable_init_while_moving: optionally allow the algorithm to initialize or
 * reinitialize while moving. Use this if you want to be able to reinitialize
 * during flight. Based on camera motion, not IMU motion. Recommended to leave
 * this off unless absolutely desired.
 *
 * cam_imu_timeshift_s: Misalignment between camera and imu timestamp in
 * seconds.
 *
 * cam_imu_timeshift_s_uncertainty: uncertainty in camera imu timestamp
 * misalignment
 *
 * T_cam_wrt_imu_uncertainty[3] & R_cam_to_imu_uncertainty[3]: uncertainty in
 * camera-imu translation
 *
 * accl_fsr_ms2 & gyro_fsr_rad: Full scale range used to detect clipping. By
 * default this is set to a little under the real 16G and 2000DPS FSR so
 * clipping is detected reliably
 *
 * accl_noise_std_dev & gyro_noise_std_dev: standard deviation of accl and gyro
 * noise
 *
 * cam_noise_std_dev: Standard dev of camera noise per pixel.
 *
 * min_std_pixel_noise: Minimum of standard deviation of feature measurement
 * noise in pixels.
 *
 * fail_high_pixel_noise_points: Scales measurement noise and compares against
 * search area (is search area large enough to reliably compute measurement
 * noise covariance matrix).
 *
 * limited_imu_bw_trigger: To prevent tracking failure during/right after (hard)
 * landing: If sum of 3 consecutive accelerometer samples in any dimension
 * divided by 4.3 exceed this threshold, IMU measurement noise is increased (and
 * resets become more likely); if platform vibrates heavily during flight, this
 * may trigger mid- flight; if poseQuality in mvVISLAMPose drops to
 * MV_TRACKING_STATE_LOW_QUALITY during flight, improve mechanical dampening
 * (and/or increase threshold). QC default is 35, we prefer 25.
 *
 * gps_imu_time_alignment_s: Misalignment between GPS and IMU time in seconds
 *
 * T_gps_wrt_imu: location of gps with respect to the IMU in meters
 *
 * enable_mapping: rudimentary lightweight mapping of feature points, leave this
 * on.
 *
 * enable_gps_vel: allow gps velocity to be added to VIO, requires ModalAI
 * custom PX4 firmware to expose this data. This is an Alpha feature, don't
 * enable this unless instructed to.
 *
 *
 *
 * en_auto_reset: on by default. If any one of the following thresholds are met
 * voxl-qvio-server will assume an otherwise undetected fault has occured in
 * the inderlying algorithm and will hard reset the QVIO library.
 *
 * auto_reset_max_velocity: meters per second, if velocity faster than this is
 * detected then an auto-reset is triggered
 *
 * auto_reset_max_v_cov_instant: if the covariance of the velocity estimate ever
 * exceeds this for a since sample then an auto-reset is triggered
 *
 * auto_reset_max_v_cov: if th covariance of the velocity estimate ever exceeds
 * this for more than auto_reset_max_v_cov_timeout_s then an auto-reset is triggered
 *
 * auto_reset_max_v_cov_timeout_s: time period for auto_reset_max_v_cov criteria
 *
 * auto_reset_min_features: if fewer than this number of features are tracked for
 * more than auto_reset_min_feature_timeout_s then an auto-reset is triggered.
 * it is okay for feature tracking to be lost for short periods of time.
 *
 *
 *
 * en_standby_mode: When enabled, qvio will skip camera frames while voxl-cpu-monitor
 *                  reports that the CPU is in standby mode.
 *
 * standby_skip_frames: number of frames to skip before processing one. default is 1,
                        meaning skip every other frame. 30 -> 15hz
