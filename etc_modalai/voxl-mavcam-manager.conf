/**
 * This file contains configuration parameters for voxl-mavcam-manager.
 * 
 * mavcam_inputs: 
 *      Array of inputs if one wishes to stream more than one camera using mavcam inspector
 *      Each entry has 4 inputs: 
 * Fields:
 *      snapshot_pipe_name:       pipe to send snapshot comand to (default hires_snapshot)
 *      video_record_pipe_name:   pipes to pull h264/h265 or raw frame data from for recording video
 *                                      to disk when the user clicks the record button in QGC
 *      default_uri:              this is the default uri to assume the rtsp stream is at
 *                                      Default value is rtsp://192.168.8.1:8900/live
 *      enable_auto_ip:           disable this to force the use of the default ip address
 *                                  when advertizing to the GCS. Otherwise we will use
 *                                  voxl-my-ip to auto-pick an ip address.
 * 
 * To change the pipe that the live rtsp video stream is pulled from, edit
 * /etc/modalai/voxl-streamer.conf instead. Other option is to stream another rtsp via the standalone feautre.
